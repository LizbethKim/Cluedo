Click the dice to roll them at the start of your turn.

If you wish to travel through a secret passage, click the room at the 
other end instead of rolling your dice.

If you wish to make an accusation, click the centre room instead of 
rolling your dice. Accusations may happen at the beginning of a turn.

If you choose to roll the dice, the amount you have left to travel 
will be displayed in the bottom right corner. If you travel less than 
this amount, you may travel again until you have used up your moves.
Entering a room will end your movement.

If your token has been moved into a room during play as part of 
another player's suggestion, you may start your turn with a suggestion
rather than rolling the dice. Click the room you are in instead of 
rolling the dice if you wish to do this.

Use the list down the right of the window to keep track of what you
believe has been eliminated.

When you refute another player's suggestion, ensure only that player
can see the screen after you click refute.
