If you wish to travel through a secret passage, click the room at the 
other end instead of rolling your dice.

If you wish to make an accusation, click the centre room instead of 
rolling your dice. Accusations may happen at the beginning of a turn.

will be displayed in the bottom right corner. If you travel less than 
this amount, you may travel again until you have used up your moves.
Entering a room will end your movement.

Use the list down the right of the window to keep track of what you
